This project has been created as a part of the Master's thesis in Computer Science in GISMA University of Applied Sciences.
The project is about the implementation of AI-powered chatbot interface developed in Streamlit, with the transformer models of T5-base and DistilBERT.
Both of them is compatible to be run locally, and lightweight with installing the models from transformers.
DistilBERT is extraction based, while T5-base is generative model. In order to test the model, several test files are created which are accessible in DATA directory.
Science and Financial based topics are summarized, and the result can be seen within Results directory.

To run the project enter the following command in Project directory:
"streamlit run t5-base_model.py" for testing T5-base model
"streamlit run distilbert_model.py" for testing DistilBERT model
